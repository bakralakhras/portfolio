Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is designed as an **AWS Cloud Solution**, inspired by the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, to showcase my skills and experience as a **Cloud Engineer / Software Engineer**, with a strong focus on **DevOps, CI/CD, and Python.**  

This portfolio is hosted on **AWS**, leveraging cloud-native services to ensure **scalability, reliability, and security.** It incorporates key AWS services such as **S3** for *static hosting*, **CloudFront** for *content delivery*, and **AWS Lambda** for *serverless backend functionalities.*  

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is implemented using **Terraform**, enabling consistent and automated deployment of cloud resources. The CI/CD pipeline is powered by **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CodePipeline**, automating deployment processes and ensuring a seamless workflow.
